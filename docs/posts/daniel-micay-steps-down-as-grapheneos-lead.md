# Daniel Micay Steps Down as GrapheneOS Lead Developer

Daniel Micay, the founder of GrapheneOS, has announced his decision today to step down from his role as the lead developer of the secure Android operating system. In an [announcement](https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1662212227561308160) on Twitter, Micay explained the reasons behind his departure:

> I've stepped down as lead developer of GrapheneOS and will be replaced as a GrapheneOS Foundation director. I'll be ending my use of public social media. I'm unable to handle the escalating level of harassment including recent swatting attacks. There will be a smooth migration.

<!-- more -->Regarding the future of the project, Micay expressed confidence in the remaining development team in a subsequent [tweet](https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1662212229146738693):

> I'm confident the project will be in good hands with the rest of the development team. I'll be training them to handle everything I used to do myself. I haven't been a particularly active developer for a while now and there will be little impact on ongoing feature development. One of our veteran developers will be taking over administration of the server infrastructure. Local infrastructure for official builds, signing and testing will be replicated in multiple locations and verified against each other to reduce trust in any particular location.

While the GrapheneOS project itself has not issued an official statement regarding the change in leadership, we will keep you updated as more information becomes available.

The announcement comes shortly after prominent right-to-repair and open-source activist Louis Rossmann uploaded a [video](https://invidious.privacyguides.net/watch?v=Dl1x1Dy-ej4) explaining his decision to remove GrapheneOS from his personal phone. Rossmann, previously a strong advocate for GrapheneOS on his YouTube channel, had earlier played a role in securing a $40,000 grant for the development of the open-source project.

In the video, Rossmann shared screenshots of direct messages he received from Micay via [Matrix](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/real-time-communication/), where Micay demanded the deletion of a YouTube comment that he perceived as critical. Micay claims that certain [screenshots](https://invidious.privacyguides.net/watch?v=Dx7CZ-2Bajg) showcasing his online behavior—which Rossmann described as "disappointing"—were fabricated, but was unwilling to clarify which examples specifically were misleading or fake in an interview.

Despite these recent developments, GrapheneOS remains one of our top recommendations for replacing the stock Android OS on your phone, because it provides a de-Googled Android experience while still retaining security features which many alternatives lack. Additionally, the project provides a unique Google compatibility, allowing users to optionally utilize Google Play Services without invasive system-level integrations. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust our recommendations as necessary, but we remain optimistic about GrapheneOS's ability to move forward with its announced plans and continue its development without incident.
